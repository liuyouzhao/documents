1. cast ================================
static_cast, fundimantal type, inherent relationship, why? It will check the type! A *a = new A; B *b = (B*) a;
const_cast, only convert const pointer to non-const pointer
dynamic_cast, convert class which has virtual functions

2. struct memory alignment ?
struct A
{
    int a;
    char b;
};
sizeof(a) == 4
sizeof(b) == 1
N = 2, sizeof(A) = N * sizeof(a) = 2 * 4 = 8;


3. volatile, explicit, register, inline, const

(1) volatile
volatile, will not optimize during compiling.

int func(volatile int *ptr)
{
    return *ptr * *ptr;
}

int func(volatile int *ptr)
{
    int a = *ptr;
    int b = *ptr;
    return a * b;
}

(2) explicit
class A
{
public:
explicit A(int n)
}

A a = 10; will not be passed by compiler.


(3) const
const int *a = &b; a can point to other number address, but *a can not be changed through *a = 3;
int * const a = &b; a cannot point to other address, but *a can be changed through *a = 3;
const int const *a = &b; both address and content cannot be changed.

void testConstFunction(int _x) const {...}
const member function in class cannot modify any member(except mutable) or call any function that not const.
return const, non-const pointer.

(4) mutable, can be modify in const function.

(5) register
register is only for local variables in a function
multi-used variables can be kept in the registers for reuse.
only INT32 type vars is available in 32-bit CPU.
too many register vars will be ignored.

(6) inline
code in inline function will be converted into ASM code and expanded directly into caller's position.
recursive inline function will lose the inline feature.
int (*func)(int a, int b) = inline_function; will force compiler to generate independent ASM function code.


4. memory overflow
(1) stack overflow?
(2) heap overflow?


5. gcc/g++ params

Preprocess, compile, assemble, link

(1) -fPIC, share dynamic symbols and address.
(2) -rdynamic, put all symbols into dynamic list. for dlopen use.
(3) -static, -share, use system .a or .so
(4) -prefix, where to search
(5) -M show all includes, -MM show all .c (-MD, -MMD, to .d file) 
(6) -sysroot
(7) -fno-bounds-check, close array overflow check
(8) -freg-struct-return, small struct will be accessed in registers
(8) -fstack-check, stack overflow check

5.1 version maitainance
After installing with "sudo apt-get install gcc-4.8"
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 50
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-7 50
then
sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
choose one you want.




#ifdef __cplusplus
cout << "C++";
#else
printf("c\n");
#endif


6. Heap/Stack
In running progress Heap:
malloc()

many debris.

In compiling progress Stack:
alloca()

no debris.

7. BSS/TEXT/DATA/.RODATA/HEAP/STACK
TEXT: Code segment.(Read Only)
DATA: Initialized data, a program's portion of virtual address space.
      Data segment contains ro and rw areas.
BSS: Block Started Symbol, unitialized data will be autometically set 0


objdump -h to see ASM
nm ./a.out to see BSS/DATA and TEXT
ulimit -s to show max stack size in linux

int map[64]; ==> BSS
int a = 0; ==> DATA
const/string ==>.RODATA

|Text |
|Data |
|BSS  |
|HEAP | from up to bottom
......  meet exhausted, but use virtual memory will not.
|STACK| from bottom to up, use virtual memory it appears anywhere


8. gdb
gdb attach [pid]

(1) info r

    %rax 作为函数返回值使用.
    %rsp 栈指针寄存器，指向栈顶
    %rbp Stack address for function calling
    %rdi，%rsi，%rdx，%rcx，%r8，%r9 用作函数参数，依次对应第1参数，第2参数。。。
    %rbx，%rbp，%r12，%r13，%14，%15 用作数据存储，遵循被调用者使用规则，简单说就是随便用，调用子函数之前要备份它，以防他被修改
    %r10，%r11 用作数据存储，遵循调用者使用规则，简单说就是使用之前要先保存原值

(2) x /16wx 0xffff...
##use p to see pointer or object
p /x (*mPoolBusy.begin())->threadId


(3) set $rsp=0xffff

(4) watch *(unsigned int*)0xffff..=0x31313131

(5) info threads
check all running threads and see the LWP to see the proc ID

(6) info proc stat 18198
See a specific LWP thread status.
Status explaination
-------------------------------------
t : tracing stop
s : sleeping
...

(7) thread apply all bt
See all threads backtrace
## to select one thread
(gdb)thread thread-id

When you are in a thread, use frame to jump stack frame, 
or up 1, down 1 to move to different frames.

(gdb)frame 2
(gdb)up 1
(gdb)down 1

(8) info args
See current function's arguments

9. coredump
(1) check system parameters
sysctl kernel.core_pattern

(2) shows like: 
kernel.core_pattern = |/usr/share/apport/apport %p %s %c %d %P

(3) See /usr/share/apport/apport file, the python file process core dump
apport's logs are in /var/log/apport.log
/etc/apport/crashdb.conf tells you where the reports will be sent.

(4) If you see executable does not belong to a package, ignoring. You could enable unpackage coredump by changing the apport line 617
#if not apport.fileutils.get_config('main', 'unpackaged', False, bool=True):
if False:
then check /var/crashes you will find your crash report file

(5) apport-unpack _mnt_1t_workspace_coredump_main.1000.crash /tmp/crashes/
(6) cd /tmp/crashes
gdb -c ./CoreDump
(gdb) symbol-file YOUR_BIN


9. fdisk/lsblk/du
lsblk -O # see UUID

# enter partition editor
fdisk /dev/vda

# see help
m
# delete partitions
d
# create partition
n


10. MQTT/TCP

(1) Why select MQTT
Other protocol: XMPP/CoAP
XMPP is too heavy using XML, not proper for IOT embedded device.
Point to point protocol, not message subscription.
CoAP need web and database environment.


(2) MQTT features
UTF-8==============================


QoS:==========================================
Quality of Service.
QoS-0 just like UDP, only based on the TCP/IP connection stability and protocol to guarantee the message arrival.
(GPS reporting, alive keeping, current state announcement.)

QoS-1 More than once, can be duplicated, has dup state tag.
(Open lock, open any door, login event, logout event)

QoS-2 only once, garrantee arrival, no duplicate.
(Payment!)

Heartbit:======================================
Send PINGREQ, Recv PINTRESP


RETAIN ========================================
  ------------
 | MQTT Server|  transfer RETAIN message immediately
  ------------    <==subscribe   [Server App/Mobile App]
     ||Send RETAIN msg
    [Device]

Resend RETAIN message will remove the previous one(Delete method).



Will Flag(Testament) =========================

  ---------------
  | MQTT Server |publish who is lost ==>be subscribed [ServerApp]
  ---------------
         ||
         || lost connect!

   [Smart Device]

11. fork, vfork, exec, system
(1) system is the encapsulation of exec
(2) exec should use fork first
(3) vfork should call exec or exit to evoke parent.

zygote need to be careful about opened fds.


12. elf file
(1) executable
(2) shared object
(3) relocated file


95. epoll, select, poll
(1) Multiplexing functions
O(n) select == poll(use linklist, unlimited fds)
O(1) epoll LT&ET mode

(2)
int epoll_create(int size);  
int epoll_ctl(int epfd, int op, int fd, struct epoll_event *event);  
int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events,int maxevents, int timeout);  

epoll_init init epoll memory cache, same slab kmem_cache_create
epoll_ctl  add fd into epoll list
epoll_wait return fds


User mode       | Kernel mode

P1
epoll_create     -> create cache list by kmem_cache_create
epoll_ctl        -> add fd number to the cache
epoll_wait       -> put P1 to wait list
                    * I/O interupt happened, put P1 to active list
                    * copy fds to the user mode memory


for(i = 0; i < epoll_wait_return; i ++)

95. top command
Any field is selectable as the sort field, and you control whether
   they  are  sorted  high-to-low  or  low-to-high.   For  additional
   information on sort provisions see topic 3c. TASK Area Commands.

   a: PID  --  Process Id
      The  task's unique process ID, which periodically wraps, though
      never restarting at zero.

   b: PPID  --  Parent Process Pid
      The process ID of a task's parent.

   c: RUSER  --  Real User Name
      The real user name of the task's owner.

   d: UID  --  User Id
      The effective user ID of the task's owner.

   e: USER  --  User Name
      The effective user name of the task's owner.

   f: GROUP  --  Group Name
      The effective group name of the task's owner.

   g: TTY  --  Controlling Tty
      The name of the controlling  terminal.   This  is  usually  the
      device  (serial  port,  pty,  etc.)  from which the process was
      started, and which it uses for input  or  output.   However,  a
      task  need  not  be  associated  with a terminal, in which case
      you'll see '?' displayed.

   h: PR  --  Priority
      The priority of the task.

   i: NI  --  Nice value
      The nice value of the task.  A negative nice value means higher
      priority,  whereas  a positive nice value means lower priority.
      Zero in this field simply means priority will not  be  adjusted
      in determining a task's dispatchability.

   j: P  --  Last used CPU (SMP)
      A  number  representing the last used processor.  In a true SMP
      environment this will likely change frequently since the kernel
      intentionally  uses  weak  affinity.   Also,  the  very  act of
      running top  may  break  this  weak  affinity  and  cause  more
      processes  to  change  CPUs  more  often  (because of the extra
      demand for cpu time).

   k: %CPU  --  CPU usage
      The task's share of the elapsed CPU time since the last  screen
      update, expressed as a percentage of total CPU time.  In a true
      SMP environment, if 'Irix mode' is Off,  top  will  operate  in
      'Solaris  mode' where a task's cpu usage will be divided by the
      total number of CPUs.  You toggle 'Irix/Solaris' modes with the
      'I' interactive command.

   l: TIME  --  CPU Time
      Total  CPU  time  the  task  has  used  since it started.  When
      'Cumulative mode' is On, each process is listed  with  the  cpu
      time  that  it  and  its  dead  children  has used.  You toggle
      'Cumulative mode' with 'S', which is a command-line option  and
      an  interactive  command.   See the 'S' interactive command for
      additional information regarding this mode.

   m: TIME+  --  CPU Time, hundredths
      The same as 'TIME', but  reflecting  more  granularity  through
      hundredths of a second.

   n: %MEM  --  Memory usage (RES)
      A task's currently used share of available physical memory.

   o: VIRT  --  Virtual Image (kb)
      The  total  amount  of  virtual  memory  used  by the task.  It
      includes all code, data and shared libraries  plus  pages  that
      have  been  swapped out and pages that have been mapped but not
      used.

   p: SWAP  --  Swapped size (kb)
      Memory that is not resident but is present in a task.  This  is
      memory  that  has been swapped out but could include additional
      non-resident memory.  This column is calculated by  subtracting
      physical memory from virtual memory.

   q: RES  --  Resident size (kb)
      The non-swapped physical memory a task has used.

   r: CODE  --  Code size (kb)
      The  amount  of virtual memory devoted to executable code, also
      known as the 'text resident set' size or TRS.

   s: DATA  --  Data+Stack size (kb)
      The amount of virtual memory devoted to other  than  executable
      code, also known as the 'data resident set' size or DRS.

   t: SHR  --  Shared Mem size (kb)
      The amount of shared memory used by a task.  It simply reflects
      memory that could be potentially shared with other processes.

   u: nFLT  --  Page Fault count
      The number of major page faults that have occurred for a  task.
      A  page  fault  occurs  when a process attempts to read from or
      write to a virtual page that is not currently  present  in  its
      address  space.   A  major  page  fault is when backing storage
      access (such as  a  disk)  is  involved  in  making  that  page
      available.

   v: nDRT  --  Dirty Pages count
      The  number  of  pages  that have been modified since they were
      last written to disk.  Dirty pages  must  be  written  to  disk
      before  the  corresponding physical memory location can be used
      for some other virtual page.

   w: S  --  Process Status
      The status of the task which can be one of:
         'D' = uninterruptible sleep
         'R' = running
         'S' = sleeping
         'T' = traced or stopped
         'Z' = zombie

      Tasks shown as running should be more properly  thought  of  as
      'ready  to run'  --  their task_struct is simply represented on
      the Linux run-queue.  Even without a true SMP machine, you  may
      see  numerous  tasks  in  this  state  depending on top's delay
      interval and nice value.
                


96. C++ OO
(1) Copy construction function:
class A
{
public:
A &operator=(const A &a);
int *a;
}
you have to realloc a to another heap space.


97. multi-process multi-thread schedule

(1) schedule
P1  [P1 registers stack P1-priority]
----T1 [P1 registers P1-stack P1-priority T1-priority]
----T2 [T2-registers T2-stack P1-priority T2-priority]
----T3 [T3-registers T3-stack P1-priority T3-priority]

(2) lock
mutex_lock: pthread_mutex_lock
mutex_recursive_lock:  T1->A->B->C->D Don't need to declare mutex_A, mutex_B...C,D
                       T2->A->
                       T3->A->
cond_lock(cond, mutex)

================================
------mutex unlock------
------wait for cond (block) -----
------mutex lock -----
------ return (unblock) -----
================================

mutex_lock
while(!condition)
{
    pthread_cond_lock(cond, mutex);
}
mutex_unlock

when notify:

    pthread_mutex_lock(&__mutex);
    alive = 1;
    pthread_cond_signal(&__cond);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&__mutex);

spin_lock: different from mutex lock in CPU usage, spin_lock keeps checking lock util getting the lock.


(3) pthread_create, pthread_kill

98. dlopen

Lazy relocation, when use then alloc.


99. Exception, difference between C++/java?
